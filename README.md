# Neural Radiance Field!

## Install lib

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training

```
python train.py
```

## Testing

```
python eval.py
```

## Dataset

In source code, we use the Lego scene from the origin [NeRF paper](https://www.matthewtancik.com/nerf). Images are lower resolution images (200x200) and preprocessed cameras. You can download from [here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs180/fa23/hw/proj5/assets/lego_200x200.npz)

## Weight
